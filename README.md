# Nuke-Framework

Welcome! Nuke-Framework is a Tool that merges multiple exploits into one easy to use tool. The Commandline is inspirated by metasploit msfconsole. I am planning on adding a feature where you can create your own exploit collections and exploits! The Code is Open-Source and of course your may contribute!
